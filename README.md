# Temperature Visualization with ATtiny1627 and K-Type Thermocouple

This project aims to visualize the temperature readings of a K-type thermocouple using the ATtiny1627 microcontroller without the need for any additional components. The ATtiny-2 series offers a Programmable Gain Amplifier (PGA) in its ADC peripheral, allowing for high-resolution measurements of up to 17 bits using the oversampling function.

The software was developed using the Atmel Studio IDE.

# Results
The project utilizes the ATtiny1627's PGA and oversampling function to accurately measure the voltage output from the K-type thermocouple. The measured voltage is then converted into temperature readings. The results can be observed through the connected computer using serial communication.
